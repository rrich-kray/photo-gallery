Learning to program is hard
Most beginners have failed... a lot
It's easy to get bad advice
Good programmers are not always good teachers

# Bad beginner advice

- Just start with a simple game
- Start with C++
- The best way to start is to pick a problem you want to solve
- You'll stay motivated if you pick a real-world problem

# What I'd wish I'd been taught

- Programming isn't about languages
- The language ultimately doesn't matter much
- There's not a lot of memorizing
- Most programming isn't about math
- Programming languages are simpler than human languages
- Programming is really about solving problems. Close to none of programming is typing.
- It's about explaining things to the idiot computer

Coding has only about eight main concepts. These are universal acrosss languages
First language is hard, second is harder, third is easier.
The secret is algorithms and data
Write out the concepts first then convert to code later. **This is so key**
**If you're lost in coding, you almost always shouldn't be coding in the first place**
If you write the algorithm well-enough in the first place, the code will follow.
Most beginners think they don't understand what code to write. The real problem is they don't really understand the problem they are trying to solve.

# Comments are code

- Most think that comments are there to explain code to other programmers.
- Code is there to explain comments to the computer.
- Write your algorithm first.
- You know an algorithm is done when you go through line by line and determine that you can do everything listed.
- If you find something you don't know how to do, look it up.
- At this point, you can start thinking about code.

# Examples

## Create a variable

Name: What do we call this thing?
Type: What type of value does it contain?
initVal: What is it's starting value?

Algorithm:
Create a variable called **name** of type **type** that starts with the value **initVal**.

The first thing a programmer needs to realize "I need to make a variable." and then ask himself "What do I need to do every time I make a variable?"

In other words, what is the problem you are trying to solve, and what are the steps you need to take to solve it?

## Output

- Message: text to write to user

Algorithm:
**Output** the text message.

# Input

- Variable: Where answer from user will be stored.
- Message : Question being asked of the user

Input should never be the first line of your input. There should always be a variable to catch the answer.

Algorithm:
Ask the user **message** and store the answer in **variable**

# Let's write a a program

Ask the user for two numbers, then add them.

Create an integer variable for x
Create an integer variable for y
Create an integer variable for sum
Ask the user "x: " and put answer in x
Ask the user "y: " and put the answer in y
put x + y in sum
Tell user "Answer is " sum

Then, you flesh out these comments with code

**Failure is WONDERFUL!**
Failures are opprtunities for us to grow.
Debugging is most of the programming
Did you tell the program what to do correctly?
It may not always be that you did it wrong; it may be that you did the wrong thing.
Most people incorrectly assume that it's an implementation problem. It almost always is an algorithm problem. Thast's okay. It's gonna happen everyday.

# How to debug

Embrace the fact that when we learn to code, we fail all the time.
The best way to debug is to not have bugs.
Bad implementation can be googled. It's tougher to google bad algorithms.
What are you not understanding? Your assumtions are probably a big part of the reason why you're not understanding the problem.
What tools can you use?
DON'T start with a solution.
